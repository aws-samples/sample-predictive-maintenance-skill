# predictive-maintenance — Kiro Skill

An AI agent skill that generates complete predictive maintenance (PdM) models end-to-end: from raw IoT sensor data in S3 to a deployed SageMaker inference endpoint or daily batch job.

## What It Does

Give Kiro access to your S3 data and ask it to build a failure prediction model. The skill guides the agent through a nine-phase workflow:

1. **Setup** — project scaffolding, dependencies
2. **Data Exploration** — discover schemas, joins, formulation strategy
3. **Raw Aggregation** — load, join, label, temporal split
4. **Baselines** — first working model per formulation
5. **Experimentation** — hypothesis-driven feature engineering loop
6. **Save & Plan** — artifacts to S3, post-training decisions
7. **Example Inference** — score one day of data for validation
8. **Deploy** — real-time endpoint and/or daily batch
9. **Documentation** — auto-generated project README

## Supported Formulations

| Formulation | Use When |
|---|---|
| **RUL Regression** | You have run-to-failure data and need precise remaining-life estimates |
| **Failure Classification** | You have failure labels and need binary/multi-label alerts |
| **Survival Analysis** | Devices are maintained before failure (censored data) |
| **Anomaly Detection** | You want unsupervised deviation detection without failure labels |

## Benchmark Results

Evaluated on four canonical PdM benchmarks covering all formulations:

| Benchmark | Metric | Our Best | Published SOTA | Gap |
|-----------|--------|----------|----------------|-----|
| C-MAPSS FD001 (RUL) | RMSE ↓ | **11.96** | 9.21 (AutoRUL) | +30% |
| AI4I 2020 (Classification) | F1 ↑ | **0.889** | ~0.99 (FL+SMOTE) | -10% |
| NASA Battery (Survival) | C-index ↑ | **0.9565** | ~0.95 | **At SOTA** |
| NASA SMAP (Anomaly Detection) | F1 ↑ | **0.73** | ~0.90 (THOC/TranAD) | -19% |

The library achieves competitive results with minimal configuration. The survival model matches published SOTA. The RUL gap is primarily a model diversity issue (AutoRUL searches over SVR/KNN in addition to tree ensembles). The classification gap closes with SMOTE and threshold tuning. The anomaly detection F1 improved from 0.54 to 0.73 (+35%) by switching from point-wise Isolation Forest to temporal PCA reconstruction with smoothing (`TemporalAnomalyDetector`). The remaining gap to SOTA reflects that deep learning methods (LSTM-AE, Transformers) capture longer-range temporal dependencies. Domain interaction features (e.g., `power = torque × rot_speed`) provided the single highest improvement (+9.3% F1) across the classification benchmarks.

## Installation

### Quick Install (git clone)

```bash
git clone git@github.com:aws-samples/sample-predictive-maintenance-skill.git ~/.kiro/skills/predictive-maintenance
```

### Manual

Copy this folder into your Kiro skills directory:
- **Global** (all projects): `~/.kiro/skills/predictive-maintenance/`
- **Workspace** (one project): `.kiro/skills/predictive-maintenance/`

## Requirements

- **Python 3.11+** with `uv` (or pip)
- **AWS credentials** with S3 read access + SageMaker (for deployment)
- **Kiro CLI** or **Kiro IDE**

Key Python dependencies (installed automatically by `scripts/setup.sh`):
- `autogluon.tabular` — AutoML training
- `boto3` / `pyarrow` — S3 + Parquet I/O
- `pandas` / `numpy` / `scikit-learn` — data processing
- `lifelines` — survival analysis
- `flask` — inference container

## Usage

Start Kiro and say:

```
Build a predictive maintenance model from my S3 data in s3://my-bucket/
```

Or for benchmark datasets:

```
Train a RUL model on the C-MAPSS dataset
```

The skill activates automatically based on keywords like "predictive maintenance", "failure prediction", "remaining useful life", "RUL", or "survival analysis".

## The `pdm/` Library

The `pdm/` directory is a standalone Python library usable independently of the Kiro skill. It provides:

- **5 model classes**: `AnomalyDetector`, `TemporalAnomalyDetector`, `FailureClassifier`, `RULPredictor`, `SurvivalPredictor`
- **CLI tools** for training, evaluation, and inference
- **S3 utilities** for exploring and loading partitioned parquet data
- **Batch inference** utilities for production scheduling

See [`pdm/README.md`](pdm/README.md) for full API documentation and usage.

## How It Works with Kiro

Kiro loads skills through **progressive disclosure**:

1. At startup, only the `name` and `description` from `SKILL.md` frontmatter are loaded (minimal context cost)
2. When your request matches the skill description, the full `SKILL.md` instructions load
3. The agent reads `references/` files only when needed for the current phase

This means the skill has near-zero overhead when not activated.

## Compatibility

This skill follows the open [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) standard and works with:

- **Kiro CLI** / **Kiro IDE** (primary target)
- Any agent that supports the Agent Skills `SKILL.md` format
